            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gandolfini">(James Gandolfini),</a>
             a New Jersey-based Italian-American mobster, portraying his difficulties as he tries to balance
              family life with his role as leader of a criminal organization. These are explored during his 
              therapy sessions with psychiatrist Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco). The series features Tony's 
              family members, mafia colleagues, and rivals in prominent roles—most notably his wife Carmela 
              (Edie Falco) and his protégé/distant cousin Christopher Moltisanti (Michael Imperioli).</p>
                <p>The pilot was ordered in 1997, and the show premiered on HBO on January 10, 1999. The series
            ran for six seasons totaling 86 episodes until June 10, 2007. Broadcast syndication followed
            in the U.S. and internationally.[2] The Sopranos was produced by HBO, Chase Films, and Brad
            Grey Television. It was primarily filmed at Silvercup Studios in Long Island City in 
            Queens, New York City and on location in New Jersey. The executive producers throughout
            the show's run were David Chase, Brad Grey, Robin Green, Mitchell Burgess, Ilene S. 
            Landress, Terence Winter, and Matthew Weiner.</p>
                <p>The Sopranos is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential television 
            series of all time.[3][4][5][6][7][8] The series won a multitude of awards, including Peabody
            Awards for its first two seasons, 21 Primetime Emmy Awards, and five Golden Globe Awards. It
            has been the subject of critical analysis, controversy, and parody, and has spawned books,
            [9] a video game,[10] soundtrack albums, podcasts and assorted merchandise.[11] Several
            members of the show's cast and crew were largely unknown to the public but have since had
            successful careers.[12][13][14][15] In 2013, the Writers Guild of America named The 
            Sopranos the best-written TV series of all time,[16] while TV Guide ranked it the best 
            television series of all time.[17] In 2016 and 2022, the series ranked first in the 
            Rolling Stone list of the 100 greatest TV shows of all time.</p>
                <p>In March 2018, New Line Cinema announced that they had purchased a film detailing The 
            Sopranos background story, set in the 1960s and 1970s during, and in the wake of, the Newark 
            riots. The 2021 film, The Many Saints of Newark, is written by David Chase and Lawrence 
            Konner and directed by Alan Taylor.[19][20] The film also stars Michael Gandolfini, the son 
            of Tony Soprano actor James Gandolfini, as a young Tony Soprano.</h4></p>
